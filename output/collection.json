    "description": "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARWR) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead's RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.\n\nArrowhead is focused on developing innovative drugs for diseases with a genetic basis, typically characterized by the overproduction of one or more proteins that are involved with disease. The depth and versatility of our RNAi technologies enables us to potentially address conditions in virtually any therapeutic area and pursue disease targets that are not otherwise addressable by small molecules and biologics. Arrowhead is leading the field in bringing the promise of RNAi to address diseases outside of the liver, and our clinical pipeline includes disease targets in the liver and lung with a promising pipeline of preclinical candidates.\n\nArrowhead's corporate headquarters is in Pasadena, CA with research and development teams in Madison, WI & San Diego, CA, and a state of the art manufacturing facility in Verona, WI. Our employees are nimble, science-driven innovators who are collaborating to bring new therapies to patients in need.\n\nThe Position\n\nWe are seeking a highly motivated and skilled Molecular Biologist to join our dynamic research team in Discovery Chemistry,. The successful candidate will play a key role in antibody engineering to support platform development and drug delivery initiatives. This position requires extensive hands-on experience in phage display, antibody engineering, and antibody characterization, supported by a strong foundation in molecular biology.\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Design and construct mutant phage libraries for antibody affinity maturation or humanization.\n\u2022 Perform molecular cloning, mutagenesis, antibody gene assembly, and expression vector design.\n\u2022 Express and purify recombinant antibodies using bacterial and mammalian expression systems.\n\u2022 Perform binding, specific and in vitro functional assays.\n\u2022 Collaborate with cross-functional project teams to advance lead antibodies through drug development stages.\n\u2022 Maintain accurate documentation and present findings at internal meetings.\n\nRequirements\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, or a related field.\n\u2022 Hands-on experience with phage display technology for antibody engineering.\n\u2022 Proficiency in molecular cloning, PCR, and mutagenesis.\n\u2022 Experience with antibody expression and purification using E. coli, HEK293, and CHO systems.\n\u2022 Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to troubleshoot experiments independently.\n\u2022 Excellent record-keeping, communication, and collaboration skills.\n\u2022 Proven ability to adapt to fast pace and evolving research priorities\n\u2022 Track record of scientific productivity, including peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, or patents\n\u2022 Additional experience in molecular biology and/or antibody discovery is highly desirable\n\nPreferred\n\u2022 Industry or postdoc experience\n\nArrowhead provides competitive salaries and an excellent benefit package.\n\nAll applicants must have authorization to work in the US for a company.\n\nCalifornia Applicant Privacy Policy",
