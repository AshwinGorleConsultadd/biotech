As more work flows through machines first, data must be structured, contextual, and trusted. We turn raw information into verified, machine-readable signals that help analysts and AI systems detect what’s changing, before it becomes news.\n\nStarting with biotech, life sciences, and healthcare, our platform surfaces early risks and opportunities weeks ahead of disclosure. Our mission is to deliver news before it becomes news, building the standard for structured intelligence that powers high-stakes decisions across finance, healthcare, and beyond.\n\nBy joining AppliedXL, you’ll help shape the trusted signals that humans and machines rely on to see ahead.\n\nThe Role\n\nThis is not a traditional analyst position. You’ll work at the frontier where data science meets editorial judgment and AI reasoning. Your job is to uncover patterns, design intelligence feeds, and ensure that every signal is accurate, contextual, and actionable.\n\nYou’ll collaborate closely with the Head of GenAI Content and help define how humans and AI collaborate to detect emerging insights and explain them clearly. Over time, you’ll take increased ownership of editorial pipelines, signal quality, and content accuracy.\n\nThis is a high-impact opportunity for someone eager to shape how domain expertise and AI combine to power better, faster decision-making in life sciences.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nDetect & Understand\n• Build working knowledge of datasets spanning clinical trials, regulatory filings, and biotech disclosures.\n• Translate complex data and workflows into clear, relevant insights.\n• Connect emerging signals to real-world outcomes that matter to investors and biopharma stakeholders.\n• Collaborate with product and GTM teams to define what truly matters from a user perspective.\n\nInterpret & Explain\n• Explore structured datasets in Python or SQL to identify trends and anomalies.\n• Assess what data changes mean for users and how they map to real-world impact.\n• Partner with data and product teams to test new features or metrics (e.g., enriched trial signals).\n• Form editorial hypotheses and maintain a high bar for analytical clarity and explainability.\n\nGuide AI Reasoning\n• Develop and test prompts that detect scientific or regulatory significance.\n• Evaluate AI outputs for factual accuracy, reasoning quality, and editorial clarity.\n• Document prompt behavior and edge cases to ensure reproducibility and transparency.\n• Bridge human and AI logic to improve how our systems reason, interpret, and communicate.\n\nIntegrate & Scale\n• Use internal tools to transform raw data into structured, user-facing intelligence.\n• Apply foundational AI concepts (model reasoning, tokenization, prompt design) in practice.\n• Document and share best practices for scalable human–AI collaboration.\n• Continuously refine and QA editorial quality and AI output across the pipeline that turns raw data → structured insight → actionable foresight.\n\nWhat We’re Looking For\n• At least 2+ years of direct experience in biosciences or clinical trials, and 5+ years total experience across life sciences, consulting, data analysis, or applied AI.\n• Strong analytical and reasoning skills.\n• Familiarity with Python and/or SQL for data exploration.\n• Experience with AI tools and concepts such as LLMs, prompt engineering, LangChain, and/or RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).\n• Deep curiosity about how scientific data becomes intelligence—and how AI can enhance that process.\n• Proven ability to learn new domains quickly and explain complex ideas clearly.\n• Editorial instincts: you know how to question, frame, and contextualize information for clarity and relevance.\n• Intellectual rigor about AI: you care not just about what models output, but why and how they reason.\n• A curious, disciplined thinker who asks: “What does this signal really mean, and why does it matter?”\n\nSalary Range: $75,000–$90,000\n\nPlease include a cover letter outlining your interest in the role and how your skills align with AppliedXL and send to support@appliedxl.com.",
